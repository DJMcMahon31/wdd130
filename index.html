        <p>Hello! My name is Dianne McMahon and I am from Canada. I am actually from it's capital city Ottawa. We have
            very cold winters and pretty hot summers. In Ottawa we have a lot of parks so we can see the change of the
            seasons by the change of the foliage. It is really quite pretty.
            I was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints over 30 years ago. I have served
            in many of the auxilliaries and have served a full time mission in Taiwan. I am grateful for the gospel in
            my life.
            I am looking forward to learning a lot in this course. I am excited to think I will have the tools to set up
            a web page. There is a lot to learn and it does seem very overwhelming right now. With help from my
            instructor, fellow collegues and from God, I feel fairly confident I can do this.</p>

        <p>Ottawa is the capital of Canada. In the autumn as the weather turns colder many will come to the area to look at the colourful leaves on the trees. Ottawa is located in the eastern part of Canada and is next to the Ottawa River. The province of Quebec is on the other side of the Ottawa River.</p>
