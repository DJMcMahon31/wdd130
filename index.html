        <p>Hello! My name is Dianne McMahon and I am from Canada. I am actually from it's captal city Ottawa. We have
            very cold winters and pretty hot summers. In Ottawa we have a lot of parks so we can see the change of the
            seasons by the change of the foliage. It is really quite pretty.
            I was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints over 30 years ago. I have served
            in many of the auxilliaries and have served a full time mission in Taiwan. I am grateful for the gospel in
            my life.
            I am looking forward to learning a lot in this course. I am excited to think I will have the tools to set up
            a web page. There is a lot to learn and it does seem very overwhelming right now. With help from my
            instructor, fellow collegues and from God, I feel fairly confident I can do this.</p>
